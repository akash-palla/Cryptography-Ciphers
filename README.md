# Cryptography-Ciphers


Caesar Cipher 

The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher that shifts each letter in the plaintext by a 
fixed number of positions in the alphabet, creating the ciphertext. 
It is one of the earliest and simplest encryption methods.

Vigenere Cipher

The Vigenere cipher is an improvement over the Caesar cipher, using a keyword to determine 
multiple shift values for encryption. Each letter in the keyword corresponds to a shift value, 
and it is repeated to match the length of the plaintext, enhancing the security of the encryption process.
